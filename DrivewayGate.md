# Overview - Driveway Gate

After many years of not having a proper driveway gate, it is time to address the lack of gate and install one. This documents outlines the overall design of the gate to be installed.

## Gate Details

The gate will be a **sliding cantilever gate** that **opens to the left** (from street-view looking at the property/gate).

The gate will be installed using **two 4" posts with nylon rollers** to mount and support the gate.

The driveway opening is approximately **15.5 feet / 187 inches**.

The total length of the gate will be **25 feet** with a height of **4 feet**

### Frame

The gate frame will be constructed using a variety of round tubing sizes. All measurments in drawing below are in inches.
